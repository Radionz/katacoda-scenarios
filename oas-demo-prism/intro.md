# Prism API Server

 Prism is a performant, dependency free server, built specifically to work with web APIs.

Some of the things that it can do:

- Act as a mock server, routing incoming requests to example responses, or dynamically generating examples on the fly.
- Act as a transformation layer, manipulating incoming requests and outgoing responses.
-  Act as a validation layer, validating incoming requests and outgoing responses.
- Contract test your APIs, given a OAS (Swagger 2) file.
- Log all or a subset of traffic to configurable locations.
- Extend existing APIs with new endpoints or capabilities.
- Act as a system-wide proxy, blocking traffic to particular websites or endpoints.
